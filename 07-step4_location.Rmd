# Location

_Status: Working Draft_

The map allows you to search Google Maps and select one or more research locations. Click save for each individual location where you intend to conduct research and then add a new location. 

We hope to offer bounding box markers in future. 

Note that for applications for marine research you are required to provide a document containing:

a) The precise locations for the research
b) A cruise plan

<!--- Offer the capacity to upload a document with a research cruise plan--->
