The system also requires all applicants to provide a free ORCID identifier. ORCID is a free persisent researcher identifier that stays with a researcher throughout their careers. An ORCID profile is under the control of the researcher themselves and they can choose to make information public or private. The advantage of ORCID ids for researchers are that they allow information on their employment, research funding and publications to be stored in one place. In particular, the publication profile can be automatically updated through services such as Crossref. This makes it easier for us to create an electronic archive of research publications about the Bahamas and reduces the need to send emails.
